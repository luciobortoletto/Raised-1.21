# <p align="center">RAISED</p>

Raised is a simple Fabric mod that fixes the hotbar! Perhaps if you've not used many resource packs you may not have noticed, but the hotbar has been broken for a long time. Not only is the selector texture cut off, but the entire HUD was actually designed for being a pixel up off of the bottom of the screen. Restore how it was meant to be and raise it up!

Includes support for Appleskin, Inventorio, and DetailArmorBar!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/raised.git

cd ./raised

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
