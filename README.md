# <p align="center">RAISED</p>

Raised is a simple Fabric mod that fixes the hotbar! The selector is cut off by two pixels, which by fixing in turn requires raising the hotbar and everything associated with it on the HUD by a pixel.

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/raised.git

cd ./raised

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
